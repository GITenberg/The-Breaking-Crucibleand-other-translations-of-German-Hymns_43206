<p class="t0"><span class="vn">1 </span>Now the crucible is breaking;</p>
<p class="t0">Now my faith its seal is taking;</p>
<p class="t">Molten gold, unhurt by fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Only thus, &rsquo;tis ever given,</p>
<p class="t0">Up to joys of highest heaven,</p>
<p class="t">For God&rsquo;s children to aspire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">2 </span>Thus by griefs the Lord is moulding</p>
<p class="t0">Mind and spirit, here unfolding</p>
<p class="t">His own image, to endure.</p>
<p class="t0">Now he shapes our dust, but later</p>
<p class="t0">Is the inner man&rsquo;s creator;</p>
<p class="t">Thus he works by trial sure.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">3 </span>Sorrows quell our insurrection,</p>
<p class="t0">Bring our members to subjection,</p>
<p class="t">Under Christ&rsquo;s prevailing will;</p>
<p class="t0">While the broken powers he raises</p>
<p class="t0">To the work of holy praises</p>
<p class="t">Quietly and softly still.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">4 </span>Sorrows gather home the senses,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest, seduced by earth&rsquo;s pretenses,</p>
<p class="t">They should after idols stroll,</p>
<p class="t0">Like an angel-guard, repelling</p>
<p class="t0">Evil from the inmost dwelling,</p>
<p class="t">Bringing order to the soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">5 </span>Sorrow now the harp is stringing</p>
<p class="t0">For the everlasting singing,</p>
<p class="t">Teaching us to soar above;</p>
<p class="t0">Where the blessed choir, palm-bearing,</p>
<p class="t0">Harps are playing, crowns are wearing,</p>
<p class="t">Round the throne with songs of love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">6 </span>Sorrow makes alert and daring;</p>
<p class="t0">Sorrow is our clay preparing</p>
<p class="t">For the cold rest of the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">Sorrow is a herald, hasting,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="vn">10 </span>In the depth of keenest anguish,</p>

<p class="t0"><span class="vn">13 </span>Jesus! toward that height of heaven</p>
<p class="t0">May a prospect clear be given,</p>
<p class="t">Till the parting hour shall come.</p>
<p class="t0">Then, from pangs emerging brightly,</p>
<p class="t0">May we all be wafted lightly</p>
<p class="t">By angelic convoy home!</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
